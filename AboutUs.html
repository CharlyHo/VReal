    <div><h3><u>Our Mission:</u></h3>
        <br>
        <b>VReal</b> was born in 2024, from the happy mix of skills of its founding team, combining event expertise and passion for the web. So innovative technologies offer a glimpse of the possibility of changing the lives of event organizers.
        <br><br>
        A goal have emerged and remains the driving force of the <b>VReal</b> team today: to build a simple, reliable and intuitive product that improves the experience of the most demanding participants and organizers.
        <br><br>
        The rest is a lovely story that continues to be written every day with its challenges and new successes. We continue to listen to our customers in order to improve the product and solve the event needs of tomorrow. <b>VReal</b> develops its technology in Belgium thanks to a team of 5 enthusiasts with complementary skills.

        <h3><u>The Team:</u></h3>
        <br>
        Based in Brussels, it is within BeCentral that the <b>VReal</b> team has settled down. In our premises, we share a refectory with a kitchen and several coworking spaces with other inspiring entrepreneurs! A real abundance of ideas that carry us every day. And if the weather permits, just a stone's throw away, we meet at the Mont des Arts garden to enjoy a sandwich from Tonton Garby.
        <br><br>
        Working in a start-up means having the chance to concretely participate in an innovative project, with a team motivated to make things happen! At <b>VReal</b>, we work in open space because we are convinced that human connection is essential to moving forward. 
        <br><br>
        Our vision of work is intended to be relaxed, serious without taking itself seriously, where everyone evolves with kindness by sharing their knowledge. Here, each member, whether intern or employee, does their part through taking initiative, regular brainstorming, etc.
        <br><br>
        Also, we organize a TakeTalk everyday after lunch, where everyone can talk about their latest adventures and discuss the subject of their choice.
        <br><br>
        We celebrate all our victories during team-building (karting, board game evenings, afterwork, pancake parties, etc.)!
        <br><br>
        As you will have understood, at <b>VReal</b>, the days are diverse and varied, rich in connections, meaning and learning. And what's more, the working environment is ideal!
